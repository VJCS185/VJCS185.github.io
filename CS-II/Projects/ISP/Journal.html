When trying to implement the AI into the website we ran into various issues. We overcame the issues by doing research in which we figured out that we need to use python scripts instead of python code becuase python scripts can be converted to Javascript which would allow for us to integrate the AI.<br></p>

Wednesday was SAT day and friday was a half day. Since the SAT was on Wednesday most of our group members priority fell on studying for the SAT and we werent able to work on Friday becuase it was a half day. This issue will be resolved by it self as there are no more school day SATs and half days are a rare occurance.

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; Scheduling was major issue this week. This week we had lots of other computer science assignments so our team was less focused on progressing the ISP. A few of my team members along with me had lots of test in our other classes making it very hard for us to make goo progress on the ISP. We can hopefully resolve this issue by working on the weekends if we are unable to work during the week to make up some of the time we lost that would have been spent on the project.

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Interpersonal  Challenges</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; There were no interpersonal challenges this week. We have started to use discord more as out means of communication and it is working well. To make sure there aren't any interpersonal problems in the future we just need to setting goals and making sure we are working efficienlty.<br></p>

<p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; This week we continued to work ont he facial recognition model. We haven't completed the model to the point of testing yet so we were not able to debug the code and find issues, although we weren't using best coding pratices. We can fix this by going back and editing the code to make sure it follows the best coding practices so it is easy to read. We will make sure to keep using best coding practices so that all group members can easily understand code written by others in the group.<br></p>

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; Scheduling wasn't a big challenge this week. We were able to work on the project when we needed to this week. We just communitcated through messages and set up a time when a few of us could work together after school. Hopefully we will be able to work freely like this week from now on.

     <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Technical Challenges</b></p>
<p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; We started working on the machine learning model as well as researching the best way to go about image recognition specific to faces. We have had a few minor issues with the pictures in the database we made previously. Tough problems will arise soon as we start to work with the API. To fix the current problem the QA engineers will work alongside the software engineers to solve the issue. We will also look deeper into the issue in order to avoid similar problems in the future.<br></p>
<br>

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Scheduling Challenges</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; Scheduling challenges were a bigger issue this week than in the past. Our group members generally had lots of work to complete in all of their other classes and we had to study for the SQL quiz. Since we were focused on learning SQL working on our ISP took a backseat in our priorities. It was also hard to find time to work together as activities and other class assignments all happened at different times. This challenge will resolve itself as tests and quizzes don't generally pile up to this degree. One thing I can do is try to study or complete more of my homework in advance if I know the following week will be tough.

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; We did not have any interpersonal challenges this week as we were not able to work as much as in other weeks so we made sure to work efficiently. To try to prevent our group from being off task in the following weeks we can try to set more defined goals and keep each other accountable.<br></p>

     <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Technical Challenges</b></p>
<p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; Technical issues were again not a problem this week. We are currently in the process of creating the dataset that will be used by the facial recognition model. I expect to run into some problems in regards to the dataset. One major concern is if the amount of pictures we get for each face will be sufficient for the model to accurately predict the person. We expect to overcome these potential issues by expanding the dataset with more pictures and taking pictures from different angles so the camera can be placed in all kinds of setup and the system will continue to function.<br></p>
<br>

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Scheduling Challenges</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; Scheduling chalenges were minimal this week as we were able to get around the issue of being in different class periods. The pace of school is picking up again and the team's time has been reduced. With everyone having exams at different times, scheduling to meet up and work on the ISP has become harder. We will work around this problem by creating a shared online calender in which we can put what times and dates we are availible which will make is a lot easier to meet up with the rest of the team.

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; Interpersonal challenges are again not a major issue. When we sometimes worktogether we may not be 100 percent focused at all times but generally we are working efficiently. We will make sure to continue to work well with each other and make sure to get things done on time. We will do this by establishing small goals that each subteam has to meet by a specified date.<br></p>

     <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Technical Challenges</b></p>
<p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; Technical issues were not a major issue for us this week. We are still in early stages of our ISP, therefore are yet to start the coding process in which most technical issues will arise. We did have a few probelms with editing the README file as we tried to get the page organized showing the roles and the team members with the website links in a proper fashion. We overcame this issue by collaborating and making sure we all knew what we each were doing.<br></p>

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Scheduling Challenges</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; Being in a different class period than my team members proved to be a difficult obstacle. It became a problem this week when we had to discuss what the team roles would be. My team members were able to discuss in class, presenting their abilities to determine their roles, but I was only able to communicate briefly through text on my abilities. All of the team member have different resposibilities after school weather its a club, job, or any other extracurricular activities and we haven't found a time that would work every week that we can meet and work on the ISP. Although this issue should be resolved shortly. Our ISP group plans to communicate further in order to find an optimal time to work together. We will also spilt the tasks in to different groups which will make meetings easier as each subteam will have less time restrictions. The subteams will be chosen based on the role, skill, and time compatability with others. We will also  make a discord group chat where documents and files can be shared over the computer easily.

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; I havent had any interpersonal problems with my team becuase they are in different class period. I am not sitting next to them for an extended period of time which could lead me to be distracted from the project work. Although I do still git a bit distracted by those in my class period. I plan to overcome this by listening to music which allows me to focus and block out the temtation of just talking to friends.<br></p>

     <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Technical Challenges</b></p>
<p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; This week no technical challenges were faced. The team instead had scheduling challenges as we weren't able to meet to start working on the ISP.<br></p>
<br>

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Scheduling Challenges</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; Working in different class periods has brought about communication problems. It is difficult to work with my team because the only possible collaboration time is outside of the classroom. It is also difficult to find a time that works for all team members. Working online at different times may work for parts of the project in which only code has to be written, although it is suboptimal as written communication through messaging applications doesn't provide the same level of real time interactions.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I plan to overcome the issue by using zoom to communicate outside of school hours and in person when dealing with the physical parts. When working on parts of the project instead of trying to find a time for everyone, a time can be found for only a few of the team members as everyone is not needed at all times.

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; There were no interpersonal challenges this week because the group was unable to work together.<br></p>
      <br>


      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Development Engineer</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; A Development Engineer develops and debugs software. They will have to write code and ensure that it works to complete the job. Development Engineers typically have a strong background in computer science and are skilled in various programming languages.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I am a good fit for the Development Engineer because I have a strong understanding of computer programming languages which makes me an effective problem-solver. I have also done many projects involving Artificial Intelligence including image classification.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I expect to face a semantics and syntax error when coding which I will resolve by searching for the correct semantics and syntax online. I will also likely have trouble getting a high accuracy because the data set will be very small, therefore the training data set is small. The test data set will be even smaller and I will also be unable to get an accurate accuracy. This can be solved by taking the time to get a larger data set with pictures taken from all angles in order to give the algorithm the best chance.
	<br></p>
<br>

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>QA Engineer</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; A QA (Quality Assurance) engineer is responsible for ensuring that the software is developed and works properly. A QA engineer would design and implement tests in order to discover any issues. They also work with the development engineers to identify and resolve any problems that arise during the testing processes. This is to ensure the software is of good quality and runs properly.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I'm a great fit as a QA engineer because I can create tests for the software to complete to make sure it works properly. I also have experience debugging code as well as excellent communication skills which will allow me to work effectively with the developer.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I expect to face problems with the software which will be resolved when working with the developer. I also expect to miss a few errors when running tests which will be resolved as they cause problems later and will become more apparent.
	<br></p>
<br>


      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Project Manager</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;A project manager is responsible for planning and organizing group operations, ensuring all parts of the project are being completed properly and timely. They have tasks such as setting project goals, creating a project plan, and coordinating the efforts of team members.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I am a good fit for the project manager role. I have strong leadership and communication skills, able to effectively guide and motivate team members to achieve project goals. I am also highly organized and able to keep track of multiple tasks and priorities at once, ensuring that projects are completed efficiently and on schedule.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I expect to face challenges when leading and motivating team members if there are conflicts or miscommunications within the team. Another challenge I expect to face is making sure the team is completing tasks on time and isn't procrastinating.
	<br></p>
<br>


      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Product Manager</b></p>

They are also responsible for resolving issues during the construction process and making sure the product works properly in the end.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I am a good fit for the Project Manager because I have experience working with physical electronics and will be able to set up and oversee the creation of the product. I can create goals for the team to reach when it comes to building the product to help manage the timeliness of the physical construction.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I expect to face problems with the electronics which can be resolved by looking up how to complete such a task. I also expect to face problems with the team efficiency and timeliness which will be resolved by motivating the team or just helping the team out with product related problems that arise. 
	<br></p>
<br>

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Release Engineer</b></p>
