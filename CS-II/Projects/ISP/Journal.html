     <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Technical Challenges</b></p>
<p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; This week no technical challenges were faced. The team instead had scheduling challenges as we weren't able to meet to start working on the ISP.<br></p>
<br>

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Scheduling Challenges</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; Working in different class periods has brought about communication problems. It is difficult to work with my team because the only possible collaboration time is outside of the classroom. It is also difficult to find a time that works for all team members. Working online at different times may work for parts of the project in which only code has to be written, although it is suboptimal as written communication through messaging applications doesn't provide the same level of real time interactions.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I plan to overcome the issue by using zoom to communicate outside of school hours and in person when dealing with the physical parts. When working on parts of the project instead of trying to find a time for everyone, a time can be found for only a few of the team members as everyone is not needed at all times.

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Interpersonal  Challenges</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; There were no interpersonal challenges this week because the group was unable to work together.<br></p>
      <br>


      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Development Engineer</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; A Development Engineer develops and debugs software. They will have to write code and ensure that it works to complete the job. Development Engineers typically have a strong background in computer science and are skilled in various programming languages.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I am a good fit for the Development Engineer because I have a strong understanding of computer programming languages which makes me an effective problem-solver. I have also done many projects involving Artificial Intelligence including image classification.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I expect to face a semantics and syntax error when coding which I will resolve by searching for the correct semantics and syntax online. I will also likely have trouble getting a high accuracy because the data set will be very small, therefore the training data set is small. The test data set will be even smaller and I will also be unable to get an accurate accuracy. This can be solved by taking the time to get a larger data set with pictures taken from all angles in order to give the algorithm the best chance.

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>QA Engineer</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; A QA (Quality Assurance) engineer is responsible for ensuring that the software is developed and works properly. A QA engineer would design and implement tests in order to discover any issues. They also work with the development engineers to identify and resolve any problems that arise during the testing processes. This is to ensure the software is of good quality and runs properly.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I'm a great fit as a QA engineer because I can create tests for the software to complete to make sure it works properly. I also have experience debugging code as well as excellent communication skills which will allow me to work effectively with the developer.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I expect to face problems with the software which will be resolved when working with the developer. I also expect to miss a few errors when running tests which will be resolved as they cause problems later and will become more apparent.

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Project Manager</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;A project manager is responsible for planning and organizing group operations, ensuring all parts of the project are being completed properly and timely. They have tasks such as setting project goals, creating a project plan, and coordinating the efforts of team members.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I am a good fit for the project manager role. I have strong leadership and communication skills, able to effectively guide and motivate team members to achieve project goals. I am also highly organized and able to keep track of multiple tasks and priorities at once, ensuring that projects are completed efficiently and on schedule.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I expect to face challenges when leading and motivating team members if there are conflicts or miscommunications within the team. Another challenge I expect to face is making sure the team is completing tasks on time and isn't procrastinating.
	<br></p>
<br>


      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Product Manager</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;A Product Manager is responsible for overseeing the development of the product which includes finding necessary parts, planning the assembly process, and helping coordinate efforts related to the construction of the product. They are also responsible for resolving issues during the construction process and making sure the product works properly in the end.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I am a good fit for the Project Manager because I have experience working with physical electronics and will be able to set up and oversee the creation of the product. I can create goals for the team to reach when it comes to building the product to help manage the timeliness of the physical construction.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I expect to face problems with the electronics which can be resolved by looking up how to complete such a task. I also expect to face problems with the team efficiency and timeliness which will be resolved by motivating the team or just helping the team out with product related problems that arise.

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; font-size: 19px; color: white;"><b>Release Engineer</b></p>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Serif; line-height:2; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;A Release Engineer is responsible for managing the release and deployment of software products. They have to coordinate the efforts of other team members, such as developers, QA engineers, and project managers, to ensure that software is released on time and is working without any problems. Release Engineers are also responsible for identifying and resolving any issues that may arise during the release process.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I am a good fit for the Release Engineer because I have strong organizational and communication skills and am able to effectively manage the release process while coordinating with the team members.<br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I expect to face issues when releasing the software and this will be solved by communicating the problem to the team, specifically the team member who specializes in the subject of the issue.
