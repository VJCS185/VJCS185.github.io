      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;"><a style=" font-family:Calibri; line-height:2; color: white;"  href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brett-kaplan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Brett Kaplan's Proposal</a></h2> 
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;">  &emsp; &emsp; I considered Brett's ISP Proposal becuase this seems like an idea with a great potential to save time for many students. I can see the appeal of an application like this becuase it appeals to me as I always use my lunch break to study for and tests or quizzes that I might have in my upcoming classes. Coding an application that works with the school seems like a fun project as well.<br><br>
        &emsp; &emsp;I ultimately decided to reject this proposal becuase actually implementing this idea seems very tough as I doubt the school would be willing to allow the steam and/or the AHS cafeterias work with our app. I would also like to use AI in my project and the idea does not include any Artificial Intellegence.</p>
<br>
      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;"><a style=" font-family:Calibri; line-height:2; color: white;"  href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-bhuta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Aryan Bhuta's Proposal</a></h2> 
       <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;">  &emsp; &emsp; I considered Aryan's ISP Proposal becuase coding games is something I find fun to do. This idea also has a cool game concept with a cool story that would be fun to code. A platformer game that ties in with this story would also be somthing cool to create.<br><br>
         &emsp; &emsp;I ultimately decided to reject this proposal becuase I would like to use AI in my project and the idea does not include Artificial Intellegence. Also for my ISP in Computer Science 1 I also coded a platformer game for my ISP, so I don't think I will learn much if I create another platformer type game.</p>
       <br>

       <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;"><a style=" font-family:Calibri; line-height:2; color: white;"  href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-nguyen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Andrew Nguyen's Proposal</a></h2> 
       <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;">  &emsp; &emsp; I considered Andrew's ISP Proposal this seems like a problem that many people experience on a daily basis. This project seems like it can keep group moral higher as people won't be arguing where they wan't to go to eat. It would also save time by emliminating time waste due to arguments.<br><br>
         &emsp; &emsp;I ultimately decided to reject this proposal becuase it does not seem complicated enough. The problem being solved also seems relatively small compared to other problems being solved in other ISP Proposals. This project also does not include any Artificial Intellegence.</p>
       <br>

       
       <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;"><a style=" font-family:Calibri; line-height:2; color: white;"  href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/adheesh-katru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Adheesh Katru's Proposal</a></h2> 
       <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;">  &emsp; &emsp; I considered Adheesh's ISP Proposal becuase the idea stood out to me. It seems like a good project witha fair amount of complextion. Using a Raspberry Pi is something that I have never done and seems like it would be a good learning experience. This idea also seems practical becuase if scaled up, it could dramatically reduce the amount of labor need to grow crops.<br><br>
         &emsp; &emsp;I ultimately decided to reject this proposal becuase the hardware side of this project seems very complicated as controlling envoronmental factors such as humidity and amount of light seems like it would be very hard to implement. I also want the do a project that is mostly computer science focuesed becuase I want to become a better coder. I would also like to use AI which the project lacks.</p>
       <br>

       
       <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;"><a style=" font-family:Calibri; line-height:2; color: white;"  href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/connor-church/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Connor Church's Proposal</a></h2> 
       <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;">  &emsp; &emsp; I considered Connor's ISP Proposal becuase the idea is attempting to solve a problem that could potentionally save lives. I also like that it uses Artifical Intellegence to detect if the driver is becoming drowsy.The use of AI seems fun to code.<br><br>
         &emsp; &emsp;I ultimately decided to reject this proposal becuase although it is attempting to solve an important problem, I don't think the solution is good. This project will keep drowsy drivers on the road which could lead to accidents even with this project in action, especially if the drivers body becomes accustomed to the stimulant provided. A safer solution would be to have the driver pull over to avoid getting into an accident.</p>

       <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;"><a style=" font-family:Calibri; line-height:2; color: white;"  href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/du-chen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Du Chen's Proposal</a></h2> 
       <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;">  &emsp; &emsp; I considered Du's ISP Proposal becuase the idea seems very cool. Creating an algoritm to balance a one wheeled vehicle also seems like a project with a complextion.<br><br>
         &emsp; &emsp;I ultimately decided to reject this proposal becuase the hardware side of this project seems very complicated as building a one wheeled vehicle and implementing this project is very challenging. This project is also not solving a big problem compared to other proposals presented by other students.</p>
       <br>


       <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;"><a style=" font-family:Calibri; line-height:2; color: white;"  href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/eric-steiner/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Eric Steiner's Proposal</a></h2> 
       <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;">  &emsp; &emsp; I considered Eric's ISP Proposal becuase coding games are always peak my intrest. A momentum based fighting game is something I have never done before but it seems like a cool project.<br><br>
         &emsp; &emsp;I ultimately decided to reject this proposal becuase this project is not complicated enough as it seems to just be a simple game, and the momentum won't have to be coded because Unity has a built in physics engine. I also have lots of Unity experience and I don't think this project would be a great learning oppurtunity for me.</p>
       <br>


       
       <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;"><a style=" font-family:Calibri; line-height:2; color: white;"  href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/vivek-maranganti/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Vivek Maranganti's Proposal</a></h2> 
       <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;">  &emsp; &emsp; I considered Vivek's ISP Proposal becuase this idea is something that would be useful to many coders around the world. Converting a script from one language to another manually can be very time consuming and a product like this will save lots of time for many people. It also seems like a cool thing to code becuase this project is unlike anything I have done before.<br><br>
         &emsp; &emsp;I ultimately decided to reject this proposal becuase doing this seems like a very hard project becuase it will be hard to make this program reliable. This project also does not use Artificial Intellegence which I would like to use.</p>
       <br>


       <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;"><a style=" font-family:Calibri; line-height:2; color: white;"  href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brayden-edington/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Brayden Edington's Proposal</a></h2> 
       <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;">  &emsp; &emsp; I considered Brayden's ISP Proposal becuase this idea seems to be solving an important issue. Preventing unauthorized people from entereing school building without having to assign security guards to the task seems like a good way to save school resources.<br><br>
         &emsp; &emsp;I ultimately decided to reject this proposal becuase this solution would negatively affect many students becuase students who forget their ID will not be able to get into the building, thus might miss important classes while if a security gaurd is present they can decipher if it is a student or an unauthorized person trying to get into the building. This project also seems to simple as very little to no coding will be required to complete this project.</p>
       <br>

       
       <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;"><a style=" font-family:Calibri; line-height:2; color: white;"  href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/cameron-farley/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Cameron Farley's Proposal</a></h2> 
       <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;">  &emsp; &emsp; I considered Cameron's ISP Proposal becuase the idea of taking attendance using facial recognition AI seems very interesting. This idea seems very practical as it would eliminate all errors in attendance, and it would save time every class period which can be better used to improve student education. This idea can also improve school security as it can detect if an unauthorized person is attempting to enter the building.<br><br>
         &emsp; &emsp;I ultimately decided to accept this proposal becuase this project uses Aritifical Intellegence which I want more experience with, while also optimizing the school experience for both students and teachers. This project is a product the can help many future generations of students have a better learning expeience. An idea such as this will get implemented sooner or later and there is no point waiting for its implemantation when the current technologies are sufficient to create the product. This project also has a good level of complextion while having a good balance between the amount of software and hardware work needed.</p>
