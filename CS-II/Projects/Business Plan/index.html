       <h1  style=" font-family:Calibri;">Child Detection in Unattended Cars</h1>
       <hr style="height:4.5px; width:650px; border-width:0; color:white; background-color:white">
       <br>

       
      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Identity</h2>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;">  &emsp; &emsp;Saving the lives of many young children and babies using AI Image detection to detect if the children are left alone in hot cars.</p>
<br>
      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Problem</h2>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;">  &emsp; &emsp; Many adults in the United States with young children or babies and have a misconception of being able to leave children in a car for up to half and hour. There are also many accidents in which children are left alone in cars, for example both parents could think that the other parent is taking the baby out of the car and end up leaving the baby in the garage in the hot car leading to the child or baby's unfortunate death. In the United States alone nearly 40 children die in hot cars every year.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Solution</h2>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;With the use of temperature sensors and cameras installed inside cars, when temeratures over 95 degrees fahrenheit or 35 degrees celsius are detected inside a car, a camera will scan for a baby or young child using AI image recognition. It will then nofity the driver through their cellphone with an application. If the problem is not resolved within 3 minutes, the police will be notified.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Target Market</h2>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;Their are two target markets. The first target market is car companies which would install the system as a part of constructing the vehicle. The second target market is parents. It would be sold as a kit to install into a car in stores around the United States and later globally.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Competition</h2>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;Currenly there are companines working on products to solve this issue, although there are not any high quility products with the same objective being sold currently.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Revenue Streams</h2>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;There are 2 revenue steams for this product which are online selling through our website or 3rd party websites such as Amazon. The other revenue stream is selling to stores around the country and later globally.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Marketing Activites</h2>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;The product will be adversited through websites that have high online traffic, televesion, popular social media, and advertised to car companies directly.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Expenses</h2>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;Expenses for the business will be in the research and development of the product. Once R&D is completed expenses will include the cost for the harwarde to create the product, inventory space, and the cost of advertisement.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Team and Key Roles</h2>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;Currently the project has only 1 member, Vijay Vemulapalli. Although I hope to have other join in order to help me complete this project. Once others join the key roles which can have more than one person each will be as follows:<br>
<br>
	&emsp; &emsp; • &emsp; Coding and training the artifical intellegence image recognizer<br>
	&emsp; &emsp; • &emsp; Creating and/or finding training and testing data<br>
	&emsp; &emsp; • &emsp; Coding to take camera input<br>
        &emsp; &emsp; • &emsp; Aassembling the project and installing it into a car
<br>
<br>
      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Milestones</h2>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;Milestones for this project include completeing research and development with a working prototype, advertising the product to the target markets, and selling the product to car companies and stores around the United States and later globally.</p>

      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">GANTT Chart</h2>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> This is a Chart used to organize the projects progress and task completion. <br></p>  <a style=" font-family:Calibri; line-height:2; font-size: 25px; color: white;"  href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UoudPpkQLdSaexPW2rlHcN3TptVZDc2LkbFjxPgK1GQ/edit?usp=sharing">GANTT Chart</a>

      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Future AI Detection Example</h2>
      <img src="../../../ISP-Images/Babydetection.jpg" alt="Flowchart Image" style = "border:7px solid #7581EE;" >
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;This is an example of what the AI detection should look like.<br><br> **Example generated from inputing a picture of a baby in a car in to an online general image recognizer. In the real project the baby might be further from the camera.</p>
