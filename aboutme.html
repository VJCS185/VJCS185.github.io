      <h1 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Hello! I am Vijay Vemulapalli</h1>
      <h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Summary</h2>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp;My name is Vijay Vemulapalli and I am a junior at Allen High School. I am currently taking Computer Science II along with many other Advanced Placement Classes. I am also passionate about Computer Science and am hoping to learn a lot about solving difficult algorithmic CS problems.<br><br>
	&emsp; &emsp;I was born in Dallas on July 2, 2006. I lived in Allen my whole life and I have made many friends who I have grown up with. My friend circle consists of others who are driven which keeps me ambitious. The saying "You are the average of your 5 closest friends" applies to me. I credit my hardworking and dedicated personality to them.</p>

	<h2 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Future Goals</h2>
	<p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;">  &emsp; &emsp;This year is very important for me because it has a large impact in which college I will be able to attend. I hope to get a good GPA and involve my self in many more great extracurricular activities. I hope to be admitted to UT or Purdue University. I also have a goal of becoming proficient in complex algorithmic computer science problems to be able to compete and move to the next level in a CS competition called USACO.</p>
