      <h3 style=" font-family:Calibri;">What is a Digital Portfolio</h3>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; A digital portfolio is an authentic, intentional, organic multimedia exhibit of student growth, self-reflection, talent, and achievement in which an online collection of work that represents your abilities is stored. This is important becuase it allows one to reflect back on previous work and allows them to track their progress over time. They are also a great place to show my experience, knolwedge, achivements and abilities in compotuer science.

      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; A digital portfolio ,as I stated before, is a place for one to reflect and track progress, but it has more uses. It can also be used to show everything I have learned and prove my quilifications to future college admissions officers and employers.

      <h3 style=" font-family:Calibri;">Why should someone create a digital portfolio?</h3>
      <p style=" text-align: left; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 19px; color: white;"> &emsp; &emsp; Overall a digital portfolio is a collection work and experience comlpiled into one place which can be used to show experience, achivements, and abilities to colleges and employers. It is only beneficial to those who make them and for some jobs such a portfolio is a requirement, and keep that portfolio on the web allows it to be accesed from anywhere at any time. For those who are continuing with a Computer Science as there field of study, creating a digital porfolio not only provides the benefits of a porfolio itself but it serves as another demostration only abilities.
