      <h1>Why is the Digital Portfolio important?</h1>
      <p> Firstly, what is a digital portfolio. A digital portfolio is an authentic, intentional, organic multimedia exhibit of student growth, self-reflection, talent, and achievement in which an online collection of work that represents your abilities is stored. This is important becuase it allows a student to reflect back on previous work which allows them to keep advancing in thier field of study and track how much progress has been made over long periods of time. It also allows you to show your abilities in coding to others.
