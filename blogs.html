    <h1>3-May-2023: BYOD policy</h1>
    <p> The change to the BYOD policy is going to be detremental to many students in the high school. The chromebooks that they will force us to use are arguably very bad computer becuase they are very slow. Forcing students to use these computers while in the building just means that they are going to be reducing the efficientcy of students when they are working on their computer. This policy is mostly likely put into place to help stop cheating, but I think the Gogardian does and lockdown browser both are able to provide the same level of security as chromebooks. This wont be able to stop the students from cheating in other ways, but instead just undermines the productivity of students when they are in the school building for no reason.</p>
